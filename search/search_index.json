In this series I wil cover Python basics. Enjoy!</p> <p></p> <p>Python, introduced in version 3.10, has added a powerful control flow structure: <code>match-case</code>. This structure, similar to switch-case statements in other languages, allows for more readable and efficient handling of multiple conditions. Let's explore how to use <code>match-case</code> in Python.</p>"},{"location":"2024/08/07/using-match-case-in-python/#basic-syntax","title":"Basic Syntax","text":"<p>The basic syntax of <code>match-case</code> in Python is straightforward. Here\u2019s an example to demonstrate its usage:</p> <pre><code>def get_day_message(day):\n    match day:\n        case \"Monday\":\n            return \"Start of the work week!\"\n        case \"Tuesday\":\n            return \"Second day of the work week!\"\n        case \"Wednesday\":\n            return \"Midweek already!\"\n        case \"Thursday\":\n            return \"Almost the weekend!\"\n        case \"Friday\":\n            return \"Last workday of the week!\"\n        case \"Saturday\":\n            return \"Weekend fun day!\"\n        case \"Sunday\":\n            return \"Rest and recharge!\"\n        case _:\n            return \"Invalid day\"\n</code></pre> <p>In this function, match evaluates the variable day, and case handles each possible value. The underscore _ acts as a default case, similar to the else clause in an if-elif-else statement.</p>"},{"location":"2024/08/07/using-match-case-in-python/#handling-multiple-cases","title":"Handling Multiple Cases","text":"<p>You can handle multiple cases that execute the same block of code by grouping them using a tuple:</p> <pre><code>def get_day_type(day):\n    match day:\n        case \"Saturday\" | \"Sunday\":\n            return \"Weekend\"\n        case \"Monday\" | \"Tuesday\" | \"Wednesday\" | \"Thursday\" | \"Friday\":\n            return \"Weekday\"\n        case _:\n            return \"Invalid day\"\n</code></pre> <p>This is useful when you want to group several values that should trigger the same response.</p>"},{"location":"2024/08/07/using-match-case-in-python/#using-patterns","title":"Using Patterns","text":"<p>Python's match-case also supports more complex patterns. Here\u2019s an example using patterns to match different data structures:</p> <p><pre><code>def describe_data(data):\n    match data:\n        case (x, y) if x == y:\n            return \"A tuple with equal elements\"\n        case [x, y, z]:\n            return \"A list with three elements\"\n        case {\"key\": value}:\n            return f\"A dictionary with key-value pair, value: {value}\"\n        case _:\n            return \"Unknown structure\"\n</code></pre> In this example, the match-case block handles tuples, lists, and dictionaries with specific patterns.</p>"},{"location":"2024/08/07/using-match-case-in-python/#guard-clauses","title":"Guard Clauses","text":"<p>You can use guard clauses to add additional conditions to cases. Here\u2019s an example:</p> <p><pre><code>def check_age(age):\n    match age:\n        case age if age &lt; 18:\n            return \"Minor\"\n        case age if age &gt;= 18 and age &lt; 65:\n            return \"Adult\"\n        case age if age &gt;= 65:\n            return \"Senior\"\n        case _:\n            return \"Invalid age\"\n</code></pre> The guard clauses (if age &lt; 18, etc.) provide a way to apply additional logic within each case.</p>"},{"location":"2024/08/07/using-match-case-in-python/#conclusion","title":"Conclusion","text":"<p>The match-case statement in Python is a versatile tool for managing control flow based on pattern matching. It simplifies the code, making it more readable and maintainable, especially when dealing with multiple conditions. Experiment with match-case to see how it can streamline your Python code!</p> <p>That's it for today!</p>"},{"location":"archive/2024/","title":"2024","text":""},{"location":"category/python-basics/","title":"Python Basics","text":""},{"location":"category/general/","title":"General","text":""}]}
